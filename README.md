## Discord bot in Python ##
The used Pythonframework is [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).
You can find more information about developing with discord on [discord's dev docs](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro).

## Creating the bot and adding to the server ##
From [here]() navigate to 'My Apps' and log into your account. Afterwards you should see the possibility to create a new App.
Do that. Choose a name, but be wary of picture... (firefox death trap on my comp).
Upon success select 'Create Bot User'. Something like that should appear:
`Great Success!
A wild bot has appeared!`
The you are mostly done.
You can use this link to connect the bot with your server, but before simply replace <Bot ID> with your app's client id.
`https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<Bot ID>&scope=bot`. Select the server and click 'Authorize'. Upon success you should see your bot at the server. You need to be admin or have the Manage Server rights thou.
Further keep your bot token secret, you will use it in your code to connect to discord as the bot client.
You can copy and paste a code template from [discord.py's](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) readme.
